      "Javier from Venezuela has a degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. Before starting as a freelancer, he worked for Movistar as a full-time software developer. While his work focuses on software programming, mostly finding new techs and applying them, his non-work interests range widely, from arts to psychology. He would love to share more about them with you next time!"

    "cover": "Hi! My name is Javier. I am living in the cosmopolitan city of Barcelona.\n\nDear prospective employer,\n\nOver the past few years, I have been learning about myself. I have discovered who I am and started to excel in my profession, as well as helping others on their paths. These experiences have helped me develop my values, including transparency, honesty, confidence, and positive energy. I am also more able to recognize those values in places, people, and situations I find myself in. On this journey, I have learned to be happy because everything happens for a reason and leads to true success in the end. I am grateful for life and all my friends.\nAs a professional, I have conviction; if you want to do something, 'do it yourself' and learn by doing. Experience is more important than rewards, especially if this experience is shared and used to teach others. Thanks to this attitude, I have gained experience in DevOps, frontend, backend, and as a tester, programmer, architect, and manager. More importantly, you don't need to know everything before you start, as you can learn on the journey as long as you have the right tools. I consider myself a fullstack developer and a natural leader and motivator.\n\nMy skills have grown over the last few years, and I have learned the importance of Production First and MVP. I have been creating projects from scratch, going from architect, running the frontend and backend, then jumping to DevOps, ending with testing and reaching production.\n\nIn summary, if something is possible, I will achieve it while being effective and efficient in order to reach excellence.\n\nThank you for your consideration. If you need any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, and I would be delighted to discuss the role further at the interview.\n\nHappy coding!\nYours sincerely,\nJavier Cabrera\n\n|| jcabreraworks@gmail.com | (+34) 634550886 | https://jcc2303.github.io || "
