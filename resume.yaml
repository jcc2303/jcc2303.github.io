    summary: 
      - "Javier from Venezuela has a degree from the Universidad Central de Venezuela. Before starting as freelancer, he worked for Movistar as a full time software developer. While his work focuses on software programming, mostly finding new techs and applying it, his non-work interests range widely, everything from arts to psychology. He could tell you about it, next time!"
    cover: "Hi! My name is Javier I am living in the cosmopolitan city of Barcelona
            
    
      Dear prospective employer,

 
      Over the past few years I have been learning about myself. I have discovered who I am and started to excel in my profession, as well as helping other on their paths. These experiences have helped me develop my values including transparency, honesty, confidence and positive energy. I am also more able to recognise those values in places, people and situations I find myself in. On this journey, I have learned to be happy because everything happens for a reason and leads to true success in the end. I am grateful for life and all my friends.

      
      As a professional I have conviction; if you want to do something, “do it yourself” and learn by doing. Experience is more important than rewards, especially if this experience is shared and used to teach others. Thanks to this attitude I have gained experience in devops, frontend, backend and as a tester programmer architect and manager.  More importantly, you don’t need to know everything before you start, as you can learn on the journey as long as you have the right tools. I consider myself a fullstack developer and a natural leader and motivator.

      
      My skills have grown over the last few years and I have learned the importance of Production First and MVP. I have been creating projects from scratch and going from architect, running the frontend and backend, then jumping to devops, ending with testing and reaching production.

      
      In summary, if something is possible I will achieve it, while being effective and efficient in order to reach excellence.

      
      Thank you for your consideration. If you need any further information or have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me and I would be deliverer to discuss the role further at interview.

      

      Happy coding!

      Yours sincerely

      Javier Cabrera
